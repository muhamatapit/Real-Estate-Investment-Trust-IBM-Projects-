# Real-Estate-Investment-Trust-IBM-Projects-

In this project, as part of the Honors component within the IBM Machine Learning Course on Coursera, we will assume the roles of Data Analysts at a real estate investment trust organization aiming to venture into residential real estate investments. Our task will involve analyzing a dataset containing comprehensive information on house prices in the region, considering various property features. Through Python programming, we will import, clean, and manipulate the dataset to prepare it for analysis. Furthermore, we will utilize Python libraries to visualize the data through boxplots and scatter plots, enabling insightful exploration of relationships between different features and house prices. Additionally, we will calculate evaluation metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess model performance. Employing techniques like splitting data into training and testing sets and performing polynomial transformations will further enhance our understanding of predictive modeling in real estate analysis. This project serves as an opportunity for us to apply machine learning principles to real-world scenarios, honing our skills as data analysts in the realm of real estate investment.
